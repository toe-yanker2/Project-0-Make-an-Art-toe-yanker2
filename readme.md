# Project Proposal

1. Roughly, what will your drawing look like?

    - My drawing will be a snowman
    >

2. What are two variables you could use so that when you change each variable, the drawing changes?
    
    - I could make a variable [smile_value] for how much the snowman smiles, and a variable [hand_height] for how angled the snowman's arms are
    >

3. Where is there repetition in your drawing?

    - There are a lot of circles, multiple rectangles, and two arms
    >

4. What are the main parts of your drawing? Are there clear sections or objects?

    - The main parts are the snowballs that make up the snowman's body, the hands, the buttons that make up their eyes and jacket, their hat, smile, and carrot nose.
    >

5. How could you use a loop variable of a for loop? Is there somewhere in your drawing where something is repeated, but it's slightly different each time? Maybe the same object is repeated in different places, or maybe a similar object is repeated but with different sizes?

    - The snowballs are similar, but have different sizes. Same with the buttons, except they are all the same size.
